                </header><p>We had just enough time to recharge a few batteries from <a href="http://makerfaire.com">MakerFaire 2014</a>, when we packed up Team Cylon.js and headed to <a href="http://2014.jsconf.us/">JSConf 2014</a> in sunny Florida. JSConf is one of the centers of innovation (and fun!) in the JavaScript world. </p>
                
                <p>Thanks to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod">Chris Williams</a> and the ongoing efforts of the <a href="http://nodebots.io/">Nodebots</a> team, there is already a well-established tradition of hardware hacking that has been going on. This means lots of cool people ready to take a look at what Cylon.js can offer to the community.</p>
                
                <p><a href="https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/matthewbergman/14117245499/in/set-72157644963162553/"><img src="/images/blog/cylonjs-noderockets-jsconf-2014.jpg" alt="Cylon.js Noderockets JSConf 2014" style="margin: 10px 0;"></a></p>
                
                <p>When we arrived for the makerspace setup day, we were astonished to find out that the amazing new <a href="http://www.noderockets.com/">NodeRockets</a> project had already been built using Cylon.js, with our framework software controlling the capsule. Amazing! More on this incredibly cool project in a future post. </p>
                
                <p>We gave our talk on Cylon.js the next morning, where we demoed <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/">Sphero</a>, <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">ARDrone</a>, <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>, <a href="http://digistump.com/products/1">Digispark</a> &amp; <a href="http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-1">Neurosky</a>. That was a lot to pack in!</p>
                
                <p><a href="https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/matthewbergman/14302013242/in/set-72157644963162553/"><img src="/images/blog/cylonjs-jsconf-2014-nodebots.jpg" alt="Cylon.js JSConf 2014 Nodebots" style="margin: 10px 0;"></a></p>

                <p>The activity day was the day after our talk, and attendees were able to build either Nodebots, Nodeboats, Nodecopter, or Noderockets. There were people of every age wandering around, all having a great time hacking on their preferred robotic device. We know of several teams that used Cylon.js. For example, the Nodecopter team that placed second in that competition approached us with great excitment, telling us of their experience.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you very much to the JSConf organizers and staff for having us be a part of the fun. We appreciate it, and look forward to next year.</p>

                <p>CORRECTION: The <a href="https://github.com/noderockets/noderocket-rocket">capsule control software</a> of the rocket was written using Cylon.js. The <a href="https://github.com/noderockets/noderocket-launcher">launcher</a> part was built using <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Johnny-Five</a>, as was pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/rockbot">Raquel VÃ©lez</a> via Twitter.</p>

Hailed as the "greatest show and tell on Earth", we were greatly excited and honored to speak about <a href="http://makerfaire.com/makers/cylon-js-the-javascript-evolution-of-open-source-robotics/">Cylon.js on the Make:Electronics stage</a>.</p>

                <p>It was incredibly exciting to speak at MakerFaire's 9th year, after having attended it so many times. The crowd was really energetic, and we were ready for our close-up after having been on the road. We demoed <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/">Sphero</a>, <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">ARDrone</a>, &amp; <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>.</p>

Taking place in the remarkable museum <a href="http://www.dynamicearth.co.uk/">Dynamic Earth</a>, the conference featured excellent speakers, and a very interactive format with a question track taking place immediately after each of the talks.</p>

                <p>During both days of the conference, we met friends both old and new. Talking to each other was a crucial element for the conference format, and we really enjoyed all the great conversations.</p>
                
                <p>Our talk was fast-paced, since we have a lot of hardware. Luckily we've gotten it down to a highly choreographed level, so we were able to demo <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="https://tessel.io/">Tessel</a>, <a href="http://beagleboard.org/">Beaglebone Black</a>, <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/">Sphero</a>, <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/">ARDrone</a>, <a href="http://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>, and <a href="http://neurosky.com/">Neurosky</a> all in one talk!</p>

                </header><p>Our next stop on the robot world tour was <a href="http://nextberlin.eu/">NextBerlin 2014</a>. Taking place as part of the massive <a href="http://berlinwebweek.de/">Web Week Berlin</a>, this conference connected business people from startups and large companies, media, and technologists from all over Europe.</p>
                
                <p>Team Cylon.js had a special place to demo our JavaScript robots, and we spoke to many people while demoing a <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> connection to a <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/">Sphero</a>. Everyone wanted to play with it, and we were happy to spark a sense of fun and wonder to the business oriented crowd. Of course, it also happed to showcase the power of the platform too!</p>

                <p>Over the 2 days of the conference, we met many people, gave a few interviews, and learned a lot about the European technology scene.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you very much to the conference organizers for inviting us to Berlin!</p>

Taking place right before <a href="http://berlinwebweek.de/">Web Week Berlin</a>, the brand new conference brought together both international visitors and Berliner locals who are the early adopters in the new hardware scene rapidly forming in the city already becoming known for startups.</p>
                
                <p>The conference opened up with a keynote from the insightful <a href="https://twitter.com/brady">Brady Forrest</a>, who is currently helping run <a href="http://highway1.io/">Highway1</a>, a new hardware incubator being launched out of <a href="http://www.pchintl.com/">PCH International</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/deadprogram/status/462135215029489664">"Software still matters. Hardware companies, you still need software"</a> he told the rapt audience. We quite agree!</p>

                <p>Team Cylon.js closed the first day with a fantastic workshop. We brought our usual giant flight cases of gear, and with <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/">Spheros</a>, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduinos</a>, and <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/">Leap Motion</a> gestural controllers, we showed everyone how easy it is to control devices using JavaScript.</p>

The venerable organization was established in 1989, and we were honored to be able to bring our JavaScript powered robots into the halls of academia.</p>

                <p>The RSSC holds its meetings at the <a href="http://www.csulb.edu/">CSULB</a> campus, which has a really great facility. We had just flown back from Boston where we'd introduced our new <a href="http://robotops.com">"10 Rules Of Robot Ops"</a> site earlier this week. We used this as the theme for the talk. We had finished support for the <a href="http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-mobile">Neurosky Mindwave Mobile EEG</a> the previous week, and it was cool to incorporate Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) into our demos. We also showed Cylon.js running on one of the <a href="http://tessel.io">Tessel</a> prototype boards, the new JavaScript-powered microcontroller. And of course, we had to show our ever popular version of Conway's Game of Life using <a href="http://www.gosphero.com">Sphero</a> robots.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks to the Robotics Society of Southern California for inviting us to speak to their prestigious group, we had a great time sharing our latest work! </p>

                </header><p><a href="https://github.com/Gozala/wisp">Wisp</a> is a really cool project for compiling a subset of Clojure syntax to
                JavaScript, without having to go through all the hoops that <a href="https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript">ClojureScript</a>
                forces you through.</p>
                
                <p>Wisp also compiles to plain JavaScript, without setting up a number of data
                structures and language idioms the way ClojureScript or other [lang]-to-JS
                compilers sometimes do. This lets you write Clojure with a fairly good idea of
                how it'll map to the resulting JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>For an example, I decided to convert the <a href="https://cylonjs.com">Cylon.JS</a> <a href="http://cylonjs.com/documentation/examples/cylon/js/cattoy/">cat toy</a> example to it,
                just to get a feel for the process.</p>
                
                <p>The example robot I'm converting hooks up to a Digispark with a couple servos
                and a Leap Motion. The robot uses hand positions picked up by the Leap Motion
                to control the servos. Simple enough.</p>
                
                <p>It's pretty straight-forward JavaScript, so it shouldn't be too hard to convert.
                Now let's write an analogue in Clojure.</p>

                <p>It still looks a fair bit like the original example, but it's clear we're not in
                Kansas anymore. We even had to write a macro to get method chaining working
                properly, but that's another cool thing: we wrote a macro, and it works.</p>
                
                <p>The <code>wisp</code> binary has a couple modes; it can run files directly (<code>wisp

                <p>Running this with <code>cat robot.wisp | wisp &gt; robot.js</code>, we get a fairly decent

                <p>I don't know if it's something I'd use in day-to-day yet, but Wisp seems like
                a really cool project for trying out some functional programming ideas in
                JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p>I also think this could be a great learning tool for people who want to learn
                Clojure without getting a full JVM set up. It's easy enough to setup (installs
                through NPM), and generates clear results in a familiar language, allowing users
                to clearly see what their Clojure source is doing.</p>

                </header><p>The sun never sets (or rises maybe?) here on Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a>. After many more lessons learned from you, our dear users, and especially after our great experience at <a href="http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/03/24/making-waves-at-makerland/" target="blank">Makerland</a>, we've just released version 0.12 of our JavaScript framework for open source robotics, physical computing, and the Internet of Things. </p>
                
                <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/8517.js" id="asciicast-8517" async=""></script><p>You might have heard us talking about "RobotOps" or "DevOps for Robotics". We've completely rewritten our Command Line Interface (CLI), and it is now better faster and stronger than ever. First of all, we've put it into its <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-cli" target="blank">own node module and repository</a>. This makes it easier to use the Cylon.js CLI tools to flash Firmata on a few dozen Arduinos, scan serial interfaces for bluetooth devices, and much more. Even if you are not using Cylon.js for anything else, this is really useful!</p>
                
                <p>We've also greatly improved our <a href="http://cylonjs.com/documentation/examples/" target="blank">code examples</a>, with both clean and fully-annotated versions. Many of the demos that we show in our road tour can be found here, and lots more besides. We think Cylon.js is the most powerful, flexible, and easy to use JavaScript framework for Node robotics. Our examples help show how you can be using it right now.</p>
                
                <p>Please make sure to follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/cylonjs">@cylonjs</a> for the latest updates. We hope you find our new release 0.12 really useful for helping handle your RobotOps needs, and making cool and useful things!</p>

                </header><p>Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> has just returned from a remarkable trip to <a href="http://makerland.org" target="blank">Makerland</a> in Poland. Billed as a "theme park for makers", the really fun and informative 3 day conference lived up to its name. Held in Warsaw, Poland, at the ultra-modern <a href="http://www.kopernik.org.pl/en/" target="blank">Copernicus Science Center</a>, Makerland packed in many kinds of robots, 3D printers, drones, submarines, and in our case, popsicle sticks.</p>

                  <img class="full-width" alt="makerland-bigm" src="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-bigm.jpg"></a></p>
                
                <p>We were leading the first major version of our brand new "Think Outside The Bot" workshop, that explores different modalities of human interaction with robotic devices. We used our favorite "minimum viable robot" the <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero</a>, along with 2 different control surfaces. Over the first 2 afternoons of the conference, we held continuous workshops. It was so popular, that many times we had a line of people waiting for the next opening. Thank you everyone for your patience!</p>
                
                <p><a href="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-workshop1.jpg" target="_blank">
                  <img class="full-width" alt="makerland-workshop1" src="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-workshop1.jpg"></a></p>
                
                <p>The first workshop activity in the workshop, was each person constructed their own handmade wrist-mounted touch controller. Each workshop participant received a "Makey Button Kit" (inspired by the awesome <a href="http://www.makeymakey.com" target="blank">MakeyMakey</a>) with popsicle sticks, a pipe cleaner, copper foil tape, and high-ohm resistors. Programmed using the "Makey Button" driver, they were able to drive around Spheros by becoming "one with the machine" in a literal sense!</p>
                
                <p><a href="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-workshop2.jpg" target="_blank">
                  <img class="full-width" alt="makerland-workshop2" src="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-workshop2.jpg"></a></p>
                
                <p>The second workshop activity used <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">Leap Motion</a> controllers to interact with the Spheros. The Leap Motion is the exact opposite end of the spectrum, having no wires at all, as opposed to people "wiring themselves in" to the Makey Button. Participants really enjoyed it, and also were able to think differently about Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) and all this thanks to the power and flexibility of the Cylon.js framework, along with how easy it is to program using JavaScript.</p>
                
                <p><a href="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-hackathon.jpg" target="_blank">
                  <img class="full-width" alt="makerland-hackathon" src="/images/blog/cylonjs-makerland-hackathon.jpg"></a></p>
                
                <p>The last day of Makerland was a hackathon, and quite a few teams were using Cylon.js to get things done quickly. One comment we really appreciated from one of the teams, that created a labyrinth game. "We were doing direct Arduino programming, but when we switched to using Cylon.js, we got more done in 40 minutes, then the previous six hours, and even added the Leap Motion controller too." It was really fun to get to help so many people work on their projects, we really enjoyed it.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you so very much to the organizers, speakers, other workshop leaders, sponsors, and most importantly everyone who attended the conference. Hope to see you next year!</p>

                </header><p>Immediately after our <a href="http://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/02/24/tipping-scale12x" target="blank">SCaLE 12x talk</a>, Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> made a big push forward, and we've released version 0.11 of our JavaScript framework for open source robotics and the Internet of Things. The major focus of this release has been refactoring the core into pure JavaScript, away from the CoffeeScript that we had previously been using. </p>
                
                <p>There are a number of key reasons why we've gone to a pure JavaScript code base:</p>
                
                <ul>
<li>Performance is better when the toolchain is simpler. Not only are we now using just JavaScript, we've also removed Grunt. So how are we running our builds? We're using <code>make</code> now, and we can run our tests in around 40ms.</li>
                  <li>When spelunking the code, there is less code to look thru and search thru to find what you need. Many programmers use search tools like awk or grep as a key part of their workflow.</li>
                  <li>Debugging easier, especially when looking for problems in broken tests.</li>
                  <li>We do not really need any compiled language features of CoffeeScript. By writing better and more modular JavaScript, we can get many of the same benefits. Even when ES6 comes out, many lower-powered SoC devices might take a while to support all the new language features.</li>
                  <li>We want to make it even easier for people to use Cylon.js and contribute back to it. Not as many people know CoffeeScript compared to plain JavaScript people. The open source project Discourse has had a <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/is-it-better-for-discourse-to-use-javascript-or-coffeescript/3153" target="blank">lot of attention recently because of their switch</a>.</li>
                </ul>
<p>We had already done the needed work to create a test suite to support such a serious refactor. Even with that prep, it took some dedicated effort, and a lot of coffee to remove all the CoffeeScript from core. But by keeping things green and clean, we made remarkable progress. We even refactored all of our adaptors and drivers into pure JavaScript too.</p>
                
                <p>For those who adore CoffeeScript, you can still continue to develop your robotic applications that way. And we will continue to provide examples for both JavaScript and CoffeeScript. But for the purists among us, Cylon.js is now leaner and tighter than ever.</p>
                
                <p>Make sure to follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/cylonjs">@cylonjs</a> for the latest updates. We think that release 0.11 was a big step forward for the code and the project. We hope you agree. Please let us know what you think!</p>

                <p>Our own talk the next day was standing-room as well! That plus the very low ceiling, made it a real challenge for our daring test pilot during our demo. However, the show must fly on! We had a great time, and all of our equipment worked really well. We even got to include the latest platform that we've added, Skynet (<a href="http://skynet.im">http://skynet.im</a>), the new machine to machine instant messaging protocol. Lots more on that coming soonâ¦</p>
                
                <p>Thank you to everyone at SCaLE12x, especially the conference organizers who do an amazing volunteer job. We appreciate it!</p>

                </header><p>We've been hard at work since <a href="http://ng-conf.org/">ng-conf</a> last month here on Team Cylon.js, and we've just released version 0.10 of our JavaScript framework for robotics and the Internet of Things. We've added many powerful new features, as well as support for ever more hardware.</p>
                
                <p>Last release, we added a web-based user interface to the Cylon.js API based on AngularJS (<a href="http://angularjs.org/">http://angularjs.org/</a>). That idea was so powerful, that we've extracted it into a new separate library. Called Robeaux (<a href="http://robeaux.io">http://robeaux.io</a>), we think of it like a universal dashboard to all your robotic systems. Similar to how a router has built-in pages to help administer it, and verify connectivity. We're now using it within the newest releases of Cylon.js, Artoo (<a href="http://artoo.io">http://artoo.io</a>), and Gobot (<a href="http://gobot.io">http://gobot.io</a>).</p>
                
                <p>The CLI that we added last release has been upgraded to support a lot more functionality. You can easily use the command line to scan for connected ports, pair with bluetooth devices, and more. We've also added commands to the <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-firmata">cylon-firmata</a> adaptor to install the needed firmware on your connected Arduino board. Likewise, the new <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-digispark">cylon-digispark</a> adaptor has built-in commands to install Little Wire on your Digispark board.</p>
                
                <p>We've also added lots more hardware support. As just mentioned above, the <a href="http://digistump.com/products/1">Digispark</a> USB-microcontroller now has an adaptor that supports all the Cylon.js GPIO and i2c drivers. We have added support for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_3">PS3 Dualshock 3</a> controller in the <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-joystick">cylon-joystick</a> adaptor. And we've also added two more i2c devices, <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/i2c-spi-lcd-backpack/overview">LCD display with i2c backpack</a>, and the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/992">MPL115A2 digital barometer/thermometer</a>.</p>
                
                <p>The "MakeyButton" is our new GPIO driver, inspired by the wonderful MakeyMakey (<a href="http://makeymakey.com">http://makeymakey.com</a>). It lets you connect a high Ohm resistor to any digital IO pin on an Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or any platform that supports GPIO. Using a very simple circuit with this resistor, you can use anything conductive to trigger your devices. Such as bananas, or conductive ink pens.</p>
                
                <p>We've also upgraded our Sphero (<a href="http://gosphero.com">http://gosphero.com</a>) support, by making it easy (read: possible) to orient the Sphero's front direction. Yes, at last! This has probably been our number one asked for feature.</p>
                
                <p>The entire documentation site for Cylon.js has been completely updated to better serve your needs. The API formatting and info has been very much improved, and we've also added more examples.</p>
                
                <p>Please follow us on Twitter at <a href="http://twitter.com/cylonjs">@cylonjs</a> for the latest updates. We're very excited about this new release. Please let us know what you think!</p>

                </header><p>We conducted the official robot hackathon at <a href="http://ng-conf.org" target="blank">ng-conf</a>, the first conference dedicated to <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="blank">AngularJS</a>, that took place last week in Salt Lake City, Utah. It was perfect timing, given that the release of 0.9.0 of Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>) our JavaScript open source robotics framework, had just added a AngularJS-based web UI to our API.</p>
                
                <p>Over 120 people registered for the evening event that featured <a href="http://gosphero.com" target="blank">Sphero</a> robots kindly provided by our friends at Orbotix. We also brought a bunch of our new Arduino Starter Kits, some Makey Makey's, and some Leap Motion controllers. Combining them together into something useful, fun, and/or creative had the participants completely captivated!</p>
                
                <p><a href="/images/screenshots/ng-conf-hackathon.jpg" target="_blank">
                  <img class="full-width" alt="ng-conf Robot Hackathon" src="/images/screenshots/ng-conf-hackathon.jpg"></a></p>
                
                <p>There were many teams that were able to complete something demoable during the few short hours of the hackathon, thanks in part to how easy it is to integrate different devices together using Cylon.js. The 3 winners got to walk away with Sphero robots of their own to keep playing with at home! It was a tough competition, but after lots of great demos, our judges were able to make a decision. The winners were: </p>
                
                <ul>
<li>Team "Beam Me Up Spotty" with a "Simon"-like game that used the Sphero &amp; Makey Makey.</li>
                  <li>Team "Bananastand" that used Twitter tweets to control a Sphero in a "tug of war" called "Red Vs Blue".</li>
                  <li>Team "Beerbot" that used drinking glasses of beer to control the color and movement of a Sphero.</li>
                </ul>
<p>The robot hackathon was a great way to start out the conference, and the attendees agreed that it was also a fun introduction to robotics. Thank you very much to Orbotix for providing the Sphero robots, to the organizers of ng-conf, and especially to all the people who took part.</p>

                </header><p>Our team is kicking off our first release of 2014, with the brand new version 0.9.0 of Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>), the powerful JavaScript robotics framework based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a>. This release adds a web-based UI to our API, support for 3 more platforms, and a big upgrade to our command line tools.</p>
                
                <p>First of all, the new Cylon user interface. Wouldn't it be great to be able to browse to a web page, and check on the status of your running robots, and even send them commands? Now you can, with our shiny new single-page web-based user interface written using <a href="http://angularjs.org/" target="blank">AngularJS</a>, that is now built right in to the Cylon API! The great thing is that it uses the same RESTful and web sockets calls that you can use to control your robotic minions over the web. Yes, of <em>course</em> you can command entire swarms of robots using Cylon.js!</p>
                
                <p><a href="/images/screenshots/api-ng-app.png" target="_blank">
                  <img class="full-width" alt="Angular App Screenshot" src="/images/screenshots/api-ng-app.png"></a></p>
                
                <p>We've now added <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-joystick" target="blank">cylon-joystick</a> an adaptor for USB joysticks, along with a driver that supports the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_Controller" target="blank">Xbox 360 controller</a>. This is only the first of several joystick drivers that we will be adding soon. We've also added <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-keyboard" target="blank">cylon-keyboard</a> an adaptor and driver for standard keyboard control of your robots. And perhaps most excitingly, we now have <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-opencv" target="blank">cylon-opencv</a>, adaptor and drivers for <a href="http://opencv.org/" target="blank">OpenCV</a> support, which is a powerful open source platform for computer vision.</p>
                
                <p>This new 0.9.0 release also adds a powerful set of command line utilities. Each Cylon.js adaptor module can also add new commands that are specific to that platform. This CLI add-in capability just makes it that much easier to handle your "RobotOps" needs. We will be adding lots of platform specific utilties now that we have this capability. We have also been continuing our work to make it easy for anyone to add support for new hardware platforms. The <code>cylon generate adaptor</code> command now uses the latest and greatest code that incorporate our best practices for adaptor development.</p>
                
                <p>Please let us know how you like the new release, and anything we can do to improve. We're here to help!</p>
                
                <p>UPDATE: We pushed 0.9.2 to accomodate a checksum error pointed out by a user. Thanks!</p>

                </header><p>After plenty of effort and a lot of help from our friends, we've just released version 0.8.0 of Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>) the powerful new JavaScript robotics framework based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a>. This release brings us up to 10 different hardware and software platforms that we support! Even simultaneously!</p>
                
                <p>From single board Linux computers such as the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="blank">Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone+Black/" target="blank">BeagleBone Black</a>, to next generation wireless micro-controllers such as the <a href="http://spark.io" target="blank">Spark</a>, to gestural controllers such as the <a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/" target="blank">Leap Motion</a>, we've been working hard to make it easy for you to develop multi-hardware robotics and physical computing solutions using Cylon.js. We have also been working just as hard on making it easy for anyone to add support for new hardware platforms quickly.</p>
                
                <p>With the new 0.8.0 release, we've mostly locked down the core interfaces that will lead us down the road to 1.0. This will help all our collaborators and implementors, especially those who are working to add new hardware platform support. Thanks for helping us get all this sorted out, especially everyone at <a href="http://robotsconf.com" target="blank">RobotsConf</a>.</p>
                
                <p>We've also done a lot to add to our documentation. Among many upgrades, we've got a new <a href="http://cylonjs.com/documentation/examples/" target="blank">examples page</a>, with both pure JavaScript, as well as <a href="http://ashkenas.com/literate-coffeescript/" target="blank">literate CoffeeScript</a> versions of all our code samples.</p>
                
                <p>Please let us know anything we can do to make it easier and better to develop solutions. we're here to help!</p>

                </header><p>Team <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> got back a few days ago from the first ever <a href="http://www.robotsconf.com/" target="blank">RobotsConf</a> last week. The brainchild of the influential Chris Williams aka <a href="https://twitter.com/voodootikigod" target="blank">@VoodooTikiGod</a> of <a href="http://www.jsconf.com/" target="blank">JSConf</a> renown, RobotsConf was planned to be the first conference to bring open source software developers in and have them leave as new hardware makers.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike a "normal" conference, the format for RobotsConf was to have just a few sessions to inspire creativity and provide some background on the first day, and then devote the rest of the conference to actually making things. Teams of language/subject matter experts (such as ourselves) had been invited to come and help everyone implement whatever it was they wanted to over the the 2 days of the conference. At the end, there would then be a "science faire" where everyone would get to show off their creations, and the "experts" would then judge the "winners". Very fun!</p>
                
                <p>This would be one of the defining characteristics of RobotsConf: the culture of fun and openness. It was delightful collaborating and interacting with so many people. Running around helping alongside the various team members of the <a href="https://twitter.com/nodebots" target="blank">@nodebots</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nodecopter" target="blank">@nodecopter</a> teams, along with so many other brilliant humans. It was almost like a music festival attitude of jamming, but of hardware hacking, everyone excited to see what each other were doing.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks to a generous group of sponsors, fantastic hardware kits given to each attendee. It included a <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">Leap Motion</a> controller, which was one of the most popular devices used at the conference. Our team had pushed an adaptor for <a href="http://leapmotion.com/" target="blank">cylon-leapmotion</a> a week before the conference, which really helped a lot of people get started quickly. Special thanks for the shout out during the Leap Motion team's workshop talk!</p>
                
                <p>The kits also included a brand new <a href="http://spark.io/" target="blank">Spark Core kit</a>, among the first given to anyone! The Spark team brought some of the first shipment of devices from their success Kickstarter campaign directly to RobotsConf. Team Cylon took that as a challenge, and we were able to push an adaptor (<a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-spark" target="blank">cylon-spark</a>) within 24 hours. </p>
                
                <p>Lastly, the kits packed in an Arduino Uno and a bunch of sundry wires, cables, breadboards and stickers. You always need stickers!</p>
                
                <p>The conference had a dedicated hardware hacking room, with stations setup for soldering, robotics, 3-D printing, laser cutting, wearable computing and more. Not to mention gigantic piles of components, breakout boards, sensors, legos, and googly-eyes that were available for people to use on the projects they were building at the conference. This stop motion video of the first day captures a lot of the tremendous energy and enthusiam that everyone had at the conference.</p>
                
                <iframe width="100%" height="300px" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/xNyxqfTGXOo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                
                <p>Next to the hardware hacking room was the drone hacking room with 50 <a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/" target="blank">ARDrones</a> ready for flight. Many people came thru and tried their code on programmatic flips, as well as even more impressive aerial stunts. Not all landings were smooth, but no humans were hurt in the process.</p>
                
                <p>We also had 30 <a href="http://www.gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero robots</a> thanks to our friends at Orbotix, plus some Crazyflie Nanodrones, a Roomba, and a few other specialized devices. Everything that Team Cylon.js had brought was available for people to "check out" library-style to use on their science fair robotics projects. Quite a few people "rolled" thru, and one of the winners did some really cool things with 2 Spheros and a Leap Motion.</p>
                
                <p>Another of the science faire winners was 12-year-old genius <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerSylvia" target="blank">@MakerSylvia</a> and her team. This video shows her flying an ARDrone controlled by a Leap Motion, and then using a Spark to release something while in mid-flight. And she was even sporting one of our Cylon.js t-shirts too. We're so proud! Here is a <a href="http://instagram.com/p/hoqO_dho-u/#" target="blank">brief video</a> showing her demo.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you so very much to everyone who took part in RobotsConf. It was incredibly fun and inspiring, and we cannot wait for the next one!</p>

                  </div>
                </header><p>As mentioned in our last blog post, we had a team demonstrating <a href="http://cylonjs.com/" target="blank">Cylon.js</a> at the <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/" target="blank">Dreamforce</a> conference in San Francisco last week. At over 130,000 people registered, it is one of the largest tech conferences in the world! We had received a special invitation to be part of the first <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/10/every-internet-of-things-thing-at-dreamforce-2013.html" target="blank">Connected Device Lab</a> which was a unique location within the conference dedicated to important companies in the emerging "Internet of Things".</p>
                
                <p>The first day of the conference, we "unleashed" <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/cylon-force" target="blank">cylon-force</a>, an open-source adaptor that lets you connect a Cylon.js program to a Salesforce connected application. While many companies are still talking about the future, our hardworking team of humans and robots is already building the platform.</p>
                
                <p>Our team showed a demonstration that we called the "Robot Economy". We had some <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero robots</a> bounce around inside an enclosure, and every collision we counted as a virtual dollar earned. Like a robotic "fight club". Cylon.js would then upload that to a Salesforce connected application we nicknamed the "First Galactic Bank of Sphero". The sales totals we would then push to a <a href="http://getpebble.com/" target="blank">Pebble</a> smart watch, to a small app we had programmed using the new <a href="https://developer.getpebble.com/2/" target="blank">Pebble SDK 2.0 Beta</a>.</p>
                
                <p>In other words, we demoed Cylon.js combining Pebble wearable tech, Sphero connected devices, and a Salesforce line of business application. Live. As you might imagine, Dreamforce attendees went crazy! The future is already here, dear friends.</p>
                
                <p>Because we had so many hours of back to back demos (10+ hours a day!!!), we ended up demoing for thousands of people. Not kidding.</p>
                
                <p>But that was not enough for our intrepid team. The last 2 days, we raised the level, and added a <a href="http://bitcraze.se/" target="blank">Crazyflie nanocopter</a> into the mix. Whenever we flew the Crazyflie, we pushed data into the Salesforce connected app using our open source software. We had set up a "perimeter" of Spheros, and turned them red to warn the humans whenever the quadcopter was in flight, or green when the drone would land. We also pumped some of the telemetry info into the Pebble smart watch. The Dreamforce team was kind enough to let us out in front of the entire Connected Device Lab in the mornings before too much traffic made us retreat to the booth. First connected Salesforce drone? Yes!</p>
                
                <p>Thank you very much to <a href="https://twitter.com/ReidCarlberg" target="blank">Reid Carlberg</a> and everyone else at the Salesforce team who ran the Dreamforce Connected Device Lab, for a job well done. We appreciated being part of such a monumental event, and it should seem obvious now to everyone that devices are now a "thing".</p>

                </header><p>We're really excited because next week is <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF13/" target="blank">Dreamforce</a>, and Team Cylon will be there in "full force" as it were! We have a workspace in the Developer Zone at the <a href="http://blogs.developerforce.com/developer-relations/2013/10/every-internet-of-things-thing-at-dreamforce-2013.html" target="blank">Connected Device Lab</a> on the second floor of Moscone West, and we're also <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">leading a workshop</a> on the opening day of the conference. Both will include lots of <a href="http://gosphero.com/" target="blank">Sphero</a> fun thanks to our friends at Orbotix. We will have a bunch of great giveaways too! </p>
                
                <p>But don't be fooled, we're talking serious business, even if it comes in a rolling package. We will show you how easily you can use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate all kinds of devices that provide real-time business information. Cylon.js unleashes the power of JavaScript and <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a> to help build the Internet of Things, and we will be using Spheros in a fun way, to teach developers how they can start making use of these new technologies.</p>
                
                <p>At our workshop, as well as over the course of the conference, we will show people how to use Cylon.js and Force.com together to integrate devices, using the Sphero 2.0 as our "minimum viable robot". Dreamforce is one of the largest technology conferences on Earth, and we are very honored and excited to be a part of it. If you are attending the conference, <a href="https://dreamevent.my.salesforce.com/apex/ActivityList#a093000000XfGjrAAF" target="blank">the session page is here</a>. See you in San Francisco!</p>

                </header><p>Welcome to the next era of open source robotics! This blog is where we will discuss new and interesting developments on Cylon.js (<a href="http://cylonjs.com" target="blank">http://cylonjs.com</a>) the new JavaScript robotics framework based on <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="blank">Node.js</a>, as well as anything else interesting to the robot community at large.</p>
                
                <p>We first introduced Cylon.js to the world at the <a href="http://js.la/" target="blank">Los Angeles JavaScript</a> meetup last month, held appropriately at <a href="http://www.idealab.com/" target="blank">Idealab</a> in Pasadena, CA. Yes, the same Pasadena where the legendary <a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/index.php" target="blank">Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)</a> controls NASA robots currently on Mars. It was a great chance to share our work with the local community, and we were really excited and grateful for the wonderful response.</p>
                
                <p>Since then, our team has been working hard on the project, adding more hardware support, and we have so much more coming. We're really excited about where the Cylon.js project is going, and how we can use the power of JavaScript and Node.js for open source robotics. Please give Cylon.js a try, and help us make it the easiest, most flexible, and most powerful framework in JavaScript for robotics and physical computing.</p>
